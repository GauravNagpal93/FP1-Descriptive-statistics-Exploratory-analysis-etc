# Linear-Regression: Logistic and Multiple

Developed a logistic regression model for classifying a customer as a purchaser or non-purchaser. Used seaborn to show statistical graphics to explore data and heatmap for correlation matrix. Partitioned data into training and validation sets and ran regression with L2 penalty using method LogisticRegressionCV

Explored data by Heatmap using seaborn, bar graphs, figures, box plots, scatter plots etc. Created subsets of training and validation sets for purchaserâ€™s records by filtering Purchase = 1. Performed Stepwise regression model for data validation. Compute prediction and made accuracy measures.
